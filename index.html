  <h2>Personal Bio</h2>

  <p>Hello! My name is Riley Bobkowski and I am a freshman nursing student at the University of Pittsburgh. I was born and raised alongside my brother, Matthew and sister, Morgan in a small town in northeast Pennsylvania called Forty Fort but if anyone asks I just say the Wilkes Barre/Scranton area. Wyoming Valley West High School is where I graduated from in 2024. I ran track throughout high school and started playing soccer when I was seven and finished all the way through senior year. Currently, I participate in Pitt’s Army ROTC program in hopes of receiving a 3 year nursing scholarship while also studying to get a 4 year degree in BSN. I wanted to pursue nursing for many reasons but my biggest inspiration would be the long line of nurses in my family, especially my sister. The stories they share about their experiences in the field are very sentimental and left an impact on me when I was younger. Being able to care for someone at their worst and helping in the slightest way makes a huge impact on people’s lives without even realizing and I would love to be a part of that impact when I earn my degree.

<h2>Introduction to my Tik Tok Invective Essay</h2>
    




  <p>In my English composition class here at Pitt, I was asked to write an invective about something I feel strongly about and I chose the downsides of the popular app, Tik Tok. Many people love endlessly scrolling through videos accommodated to them but don't realize the kind of effects it has on today’s society.

<h2>Tik Tok Invective</h2>
<p> In a world where social media dictates our everyday lives, Tik Tok showed the darker side of what social media can look like. When the platform came out in 2016 and replaced popular social media app Musical.ly, Tik Tok was a fun space that many people posted fun and creative content on (Geyser). Tik Tok’s content has become absurd and even controversial at some points with users posting ridiculous videos that blow up getting millions of views. Over the years, Tik Tok in general has brought up many concerns and impacted society in negative ways especially with the more impressionable younger generations. 

Social media often creates a certain standard for people to follow and keep up with.  Tik Tok, an app made for fun short videos often makes the struggle worse for people who do not fit into the set standards. The anonymous nature of the internet allows users to harass creators in comment sections or even collaborate with the video on their own page expressing their negativity towards another user. Users can hide behind a screen without any real consequence for their actions. It is easy to leave an unnecessary hurtful comment that can change another user from behind the screen because some people don't know where to draw the line (“The Toxicity of TikTok”).  

Going hand in hand with Tik Tok’s toxicity is its negative impact on mental health. Cyberbullying is not the only way the popular app affects mental health. Some users post content pertaining to suicide and self-harm giving ideas to younger generations. Not only does Tik Tok show these videos, once someone interacts with these videos, an algorithm puts more content like that onto the users for you page. “The Algorithmic Transparency Institute (ATI) at the National Conference on Citizenship and AI Forensics – show how children and young people who watch mental health-related content on TikTok’s ‘For You’ page are quickly being drawn into “rabbit holes” of potentially harmful content, including videos that romanticize and encourage depressive thinking, self-harm, and suicide” (Amnesty International). Falling into one of these traps can be bad for mental health and with all Tik Tok’s users, these videos can become very widespread for many people to view. 

One aspect of the popular app that can’t be overlooked is its addictive nature. People get lost in scrolling and lose track of time and all other responsibilities. Screen time is one of the features of this app that allows users to see how much time they spend scrolling through on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Since the release screen time has increased significantly. “In 2020, the global average stood at 13 hours and 18 minutes per month. By 2022, this figure had increased by 76.7%, reaching 23 hours and 30 minutes. In other words, the average person spends 3% of their month on TikTok or 5% of their total waking hours” (Duarte). With this increase in screen time due to Tik Tok, it leaves users distracted from their true responsibilities, whether it is children with schoolwork or adults with their jobs.  

Tik Tok can also be very unsafe for users of all ages because of the lack of privacy. With the internet these days it is very easy to find things out, even from the little amount of information a video can contain. Anyone has access to Tik Tok including stalkers and predators, which has made it easy for these kinds of people to communicate or lurk on other users (Broderick). Many Tik Tok users create dancing videos which can be sexualized by these predators and stalkers. With that there are also younger eyes watching these videos and recreating what they have watched, which in turn can lead to easier victims for predators and stalkers. 

Tik Tok has many negative effects on its users, even if the users may be blissfully unaware while using it. Although it may seem blissful while using it, the effects can harm one person or a group of people. Social standards can impact users and create unrealistic perspectives in the real world. This social media platform has a vast amount of different content that is particularly good at matching the mood one can be in from personal experience, which leads to the “rabbit hole” causing a lot of emotion to surface depending on what mood a person can be in. Not only does it affect the mental health of a person, but it can also be very unsafe for users who are not fully aware of what they are posting and who can be watching.  The effects of Tik Tok may even go unrecognized because of its addictive nature. The popular app in general has a lot of power over today’s society as it is one of those apps that has something of interest for everyone. 

This essay is directed mostly towards the young, highly impressionable generations growing up in Tik Tok’s prime. As I get older and more nostalgic about my childhood, I think about all the things in my life that made an impact on who I am today and at some point, social media became one of them. I have had good and bad experiences with social media, Tik Tok being included. Being aware of body image and social standards was not one of my concerns until social media came along when I was older and able to understand it more. Kids growing up will not have the same luxury simply because social media is one of the many things our world depends on. Tik Tok, being one of the main platforms, has the ability to shape how a kid thinks or sees themselves until they get older and realize none of this stuff matters anyway. With the toxic environment Tik Tok can be, it would be wise to keep young ones away so the behind the screen struggles are out of mind, out of sight.

<h2>Why I came to Pitt</h2> <!--Extra section 1-->


<p>I came to the University of Pittsburgh after graduation because of its high standards for excellence and the vibe of the city. After recent news, the Nursing program at Pitt is tied for 4th in the nation! During high school, I also had interest in joining the reserves as a nurse. Here at Pitt, they have a great ROTC program which I joined as soon as I got to campus during orientation week. I plan to either go active duty or join the national guard as a nurse after getting my degree. Other than academics, the city is a beautiful place and I enjoy getting to experience the independence that comes with being here!

</p> </div>
<!--This is my first extra section on why I came to Pitt because to me its something I would want to know about someone.-->

  <h2>Family back home</h2> <!--extra section 2-->



  <p>Back home, I live with a family of five and three dogs. I’m very much a dog person so I consider them part of the family. One is a Saint Bernard, a Maltipoo, and the last one is a Malshi. Out of all my siblings, I am the youngest of three having one older brother who went to Penn State for engineering and a sister who went to Misericordia for nursing. My family are some of my biggest supporters and inspirations. My sister is one of the reasons I am majoring in nursing in the first place. Without the support of my family, I wouldn’t be at one of the best nursing schools in the nation and living out my dreams.

<!--This is my second extra section because my family is a huge part of my life and where I am today. I can very easily say they are part of the reason I was able to get into Pitt's Nursing program.-->
